                on virtual tour to Egypt!
            </p>
            <p class="main_info">We wonder if you know what is the most famous sight of Egypt. 
                Yes, you are absolutely right – there are the Great Pyramids! If you visit Egypt you’ll 
                definitely see them. But what do we know about them except they are among
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World" class="main_info_link">the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</a> ? So, let’s start our virtual excursion!
            </p>
            <p class="main_info">You’ll surprise to know that scientists have found more than 118 pyramids, which had been built between 2575-2465 BC.
                But the largest pyramid is the Great Pyramid of King Khufu (we know him as Pharaoh Kheops). It took the Egyptians 20
                years to build it. Ancient historian Herodotus said, that about 100.000 man had worked to built the Great Pyramid. But
                modern Egyptologists suppose, that there were from 20.000 to 30.000 man, who had been involved in the process of
                building. The Great Pyramid consists of about 2.300.000 blocks and the average weight of each one is about 2.5 tons.
            </p>
            <p class="main_info">But what was the purpose of those pyramids? The ancient Egyptians believed in life after death, so, those pyramids were
                buildings where dead kings and queens were placed with other things like furniture, clothes, weapons and a lot of gold
                jewellery. The Ancient Egyptians believed , that all those things would be used by kings and queens after their death in
                the next life.
            </p>
            <p class="main_info">The Great Pyramids are rightly included in the list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. They are geometrically
                perfect and have almost symmetrical sides. Sometimes it’s difficult to believe that those huge buildings were built by
                human hands.
            </p>
            <p class="main_info">So, if you have never been to Egypt before, you have a great motivation to get on the first plane to Egypt and to see
                those amazing Pyramids with your own eyes.
